The "Database Fetch.py" file is where all of the python code is stored and executed

The "deviceinfo.csv", "employeeinfo.csv", and the "ticket.csv" are all spreadsheets that
store the database information into a local file. This was mainly for testing purposes.

The "New Device.csv", "New Employee.csv", and the "New Ticket.csv" files are all for 
inserting data from local machine into database. These files were once again for testing
purposes.

In the "Database Fetch.py" file the code past line 200 is a rewrite that would allow the
code to directly return data and send data from python. 
Currently looking into integration with react and this code.
Will also create a more dynamic search method to query the database.
